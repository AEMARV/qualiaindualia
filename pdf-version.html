    <div class="content-text">
      I explore the intersection of consciousness, randomness, and meaning through oil painting. My work emerges from the dialogue between the rational and the a-rational, where oil on canvas, unknown by the artist, paints a picture, and I follow the trail of stories with no restriction. Each painting is accompanied by poetry that emerges from the same subconscious space, creating a complete artistic experience that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.

          In the garden of Venus, where roses bloom<br>
          And the air is thick with the scent of love,<br>
          There walks a figure, wrapped in blue,<br>
          Her eyes reflecting the sky above.<br><br>
          
          She moves like water, fluid and free,<br>
          Her presence a mystery to behold,<br>

          To stories that have never been told.<br><br>
          
          Blue is the color of her soul,<br>
          Deep as the ocean, bright as the sky,<br>
          In her embrace, we become whole,<br>
          As she teaches us how to fly.

    <div class="content-text">
      <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>
      <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Cloud painting - a unique methodology using random number generation as starting point. I plot numbers to create visual patterns, transfer them to canvas with oil paint, and allow subconscious imagery to emerge. This creates a "Self-Rorschach test" where the unknown artist within guides the process.</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Each work begins with mathematical randomness, evolves through oil painting, and concludes with poetry that emerges from the same creative space. This creates a complete artistic cycle from algorithm to canvas to verse.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Brief Biography</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
      <p>Amir Emad Marvasti is an artist and researcher based in Orlando, FL. With a PhD in Computer Science from University of Central Florida (2014-2021) and research experience at Northwestern University's Machine and Hybrid Intelligence Lab (2021-2022), I bring a unique perspective to art that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.</p>
      <p>My artistic practice as "Qualia in Dualia" explores consciousness, duality, and the intersection of technology and human experience. I have developed a distinctive cloud painting technique that uses random number generation to create visual patterns, allowing subconscious imagery to emerge through oil painting.</p>
      <p>Currently, I am the founder of Geography of Opinions, a social platform for mapping public opinions, and continue to develop my oil painting practice with a focus on creating welcoming spaces for interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>

      <p><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> To create a welcoming studio environment that serves as a bridge between the Maitland art community and the Art and History Museums, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration.</p>
      <p><strong>Project Focus:</strong> Continue developing my cloud painting technique while creating an inspiring studio space that welcomes guests from any discipline. The studio will feature ongoing works-in-progress, allowing visitors to witness the evolution from mathematical randomness to finished oil paintings.</p>
      <p><strong>Community Integration:</strong> Connect local artists in the Maitland neighborhood with the museum's resources and programming. I will serve as a liaison, introducing artists to the museum's facilities and encouraging participation in museum events.</p>
      <p><strong>Educational Component:</strong> Offer workshops on the intersection of technology and art, demonstrating how mathematical concepts can inform artistic practice. These workshops will be scheduled through the Art School Manager.</p>
      <p><strong>Historical Mission Alignment:</strong> My experimental approach to art through cloud painting directly aligns with Jules André Smith's Research Studio spirit of exploration and innovation. The technique challenges traditional artistic boundaries while honoring the museum's commitment to experimental approaches.</p>
