      <div class="statement-text">
        I explore the intersection of consciousness, randomness, and meaning through oil painting. My work emerges from the dialogue between the rational and the a-rational, where oil on canvas, unknown by the artist, paints a picture, and I follow the trail of stories with no restriction. Each painting is accompanied by poetry that emerges from the same subconscious space, creating a complete artistic experience that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.

      <div class="content-text">
        <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>
        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Cloud painting - a unique methodology using random number generation as starting point. I plot numbers to create visual patterns, transfer them to canvas with oil paint, and allow subconscious imagery to emerge. This creates a "Self-Rorschach test" where the unknown artist within guides the process.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> Each work begins with mathematical randomness, evolves through oil painting, and concludes with poetry that emerges from the same creative space. This creates a complete artistic cycle from algorithm to canvas to verse.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Brief Biography</h2>
      <div class="content-text">
        <p>Amir Emad Marvasti is an artist and researcher based in Orlando, FL. With a PhD in Computer Science from University of Central Florida (2014-2021) and research experience at Northwestern University's Machine and Hybrid Intelligence Lab (2021-2022), I bring a unique perspective to art that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.</p>
        <p>My artistic practice as "Qualia in Dualia" explores consciousness, duality, and the intersection of technology and human experience. I have developed a distinctive cloud painting technique that uses random number generation to create visual patterns, allowing subconscious imagery to emerge through oil painting.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am the founder of Geography of Opinions, a social platform for mapping public opinions, and continue to develop my oil painting practice with a focus on creating welcoming spaces for interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Residency Objectives</h2>
      <div class="content-text">
        <p><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> To create a welcoming studio environment that serves as a bridge between the Maitland art community and the Art and History Museums, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration.</p>
        <p><strong>Project Focus:</strong> Continue developing my cloud painting technique while creating an inspiring studio space that welcomes guests from any discipline. The studio will feature ongoing works-in-progress, allowing visitors to witness the evolution from mathematical randomness to finished oil paintings.</p>
        <p><strong>Community Integration:</strong> Connect local artists in the Maitland neighborhood with the museum's resources and programming. I will serve as a liaison, introducing artists to the museum's facilities and encouraging participation in museum events.</p>
        <p><strong>Educational Component:</strong> Offer workshops on the intersection of technology and art, demonstrating how mathematical concepts can inform artistic practice. These workshops will be scheduled through the Art School Manager.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical Mission Alignment:</strong> My experimental approach to art through cloud painting directly aligns with Jules Andr√© Smith's Research Studio spirit of exploration and innovation. The technique challenges traditional artistic boundaries while honoring the museum's commitment to experimental approaches.</p>
