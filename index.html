      <div class="statement-text">
        I explore the intersection of consciousness, randomness, and meaning through oil painting. My work emerges from the dialogue between the rational and the a-rational, where oil on canvas, unknown by the artist, paints a picture, and I follow the trail of stories with no restriction. Each painting is accompanied by poetry that emerges from the same subconscious space, creating a complete artistic experience that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.

      <div class="content-text">
        <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Oil on canvas</p>
        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Cloud painting - a unique methodology where I begin with random brushings on canvas until images emerge from the paint. When I see a clear image, I enter a careful stage to bring out and refine what has appeared. This creates a "Self-Rorschach test" where the unknown artist within guides the process.</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> Each work begins with spontaneous brushwork, evolves through careful oil painting to reveal emerging imagery, and concludes with poetry that emerges from the same creative space. This creates a complete artistic cycle from randomness to canvas to verse.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Brief Biography</h2>
      <div class="content-text">
        <p>Amir Emad Marvasti is an artist and researcher based in Orlando, FL. With a PhD in Computer Science from University of Central Florida (2014-2021) and research experience at Northwestern University's Machine and Hybrid Intelligence Lab (2021-2022), I bring a unique perspective to art that bridges scientific rigor with artistic expression.</p>
        <p>My artistic practice as "Qualia in Dualia" explores consciousness, duality, and the intersection of technology and human experience. I have developed a distinctive cloud painting technique that begins with random brushings until images emerge, allowing subconscious imagery to guide the painting process.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am the founder of Geography of Opinions, a social platform for mapping public opinions, and continue to develop my oil painting practice with a focus on creating welcoming spaces for interdisciplinary dialogue.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Residency Objectives</h2>
      <div class="content-text">
        <p><strong>Primary Mission:</strong> To explore philosophy through the lens of aesthetics, developing a romantic perspective on existential philosophy while creating a welcoming space for interdisciplinary dialogue and community communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Core Focus Areas:</strong> My work centers on Existential Philosophy, Cognition, and Time and Memory. Through my cloud painting technique, I investigate these themes by allowing subconscious imagery to emerge from random brushings, creating a bridge between philosophical inquiry and artistic expression.</p>
        <p><strong>Community Space:</strong> Create a welcoming studio environment that serves as a bridge between the Maitland art community and the Art and History Museums, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration among diverse disciplines.</p>
        <p><strong>Studio Practice:</strong> Continue developing my cloud painting technique while creating an inspiring studio space that welcomes guests from any discipline. The studio will feature ongoing works-in-progress, allowing visitors to witness the evolution from spontaneous brushwork to finished oil paintings.</p>
        <p><strong>Educational Component:</strong> Offer workshops and discussions on the intersection of philosophy, aesthetics, and artistic practice, exploring how existential questions can be approached through creative expression. These sessions will be scheduled through the Art School Manager.</p>
        <p><strong>Historical Mission Alignment:</strong> My experimental approach to art through cloud painting directly aligns with Jules Andr√© Smith's Research Studio spirit of exploration and innovation. The technique challenges traditional artistic boundaries while honoring the museum's commitment to experimental approaches.</p>
