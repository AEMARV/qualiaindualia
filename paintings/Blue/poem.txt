And here I am, Venus,
Once Loved by you
Judged by Zeus
Rejected by Hades
I am Adonis

Last held by you
Lost in my blood
Lost in your tears
Last In your arms

And again,
In here I am, Venus
I am Adonis

Raised by Persephone
Born in the deepest of the blues
Veins colored with red,
the pomegranate seeds
Clayed by the dreams
Eyes forged from the broken blades of old gods
Soft in skin
Diamond within
Loved by you
Judged by Zeus
And now Zeus is not
Zeus is gone
And now Hades is not
Hades is gone
And now begins our time
I Adonis
You Venus

And with the last of your tear
With the wind
My name shattered, my name scattered
And with the last of my blood
you blended into the ocean,
into the sun
You blended into the moon
into the trees

Until my name was whispered
Until your face was seen
Until the wind told the secret
Your scent heard in the breeze
And the sun unraveled your face
And flora was there
And the graces danced
And you were reborn with me

For Deities we are,
Venus,
you and I,
I Adonis
And now I am
Found you once again
And I wont fear the serpent no more
And I wont hunt the boar no more
And I am here,
And Zeus and Hades are no more
And I am 
Once again born
In your form
you Venus
I Adonis
Heard your scent in the air
And I came back
And hades is no more
I Adonis
You Venus

And the favored breeze is upon us
And flora orantes our way
And time will be kind
and your scent will forever remain 

For Deities we are
You Venus,
I Adonis
