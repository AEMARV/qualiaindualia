Veils Unveiled

Veils unveiled,
Who is out there?
Is there anyone behind or am I chasing the veiled absurd
Veils on veils
the anxious eternal search
And A glimpse of the sight of her
And she hides away
As soon as I find her

Veils on veils
Psyche laid in bed
A ruse, and a ruse to see all truth
Truth, as Bare, and Nude as her,
Bright, as the candle on the right side of her bed
And with the sight, cupid flew away
Veils fell on Veils

The Never ending story of a chase
Undestined
A wild dream for the sane and unsane
And the eventual question
Was I referencing you
When you reflected I?
Mirrors mirror each other?
The self reference?
Your face to face mine
Self reference, for you that only love all those who dont love themselves
And the paradox, do you love yourself?
A Russel reference.
For those that are the birth of the romance
The free rotations of truths in a sentence,
A wheel,
Revolution of the lovers, the poles
And "so it goes", and the wheel rolls
Kurt's refrence

Veils on Veils
Is the veil her
Or her behind the veil
And the chase, was destined
And you laid next to truth
And mosses uncovered your face
And you remained, embraced
Rebirth of the two
In the tomb of Emily's mind, Dickinson
A reference

Funny, one day
I saw with my eyes,
In one afternoon,
In my lifetime,
Finally Mars' spear
Was taken by venus
And she held the spear
A first,
In one glimpse, less than a second
Portrayed by a Roman
Stevie D'Ercole,
And I doubted,
Were they ever seperate?
Mars and Venus?
And I doubted
Are we the story tellers?
Meaning given and taken away
At will, in the dark depth of within
And the story retold to eye
After I had forgotten
All a new and all a surprise
Veils on Veils

And no, and no,
This story is true
And true meant True
Exists, the absolute
The grand piece

created? Veils on veils
discovered? Veils unveiled

In my trench, my heart is warm and the stars, distant but bright.
discovered, unveiled, embraced, I whisper to myself
And the wait always meant
For you, the companion to reason and every edge of every triangle and square. 
For you, that tiptoe behind the dark satin
And dance on the light waters
For you, covered by sights and sounds
And I
Still In the trench,
And time drips for you here
To come back in the shadow of the leaves of that tree
In refractions of the bright lights
In splashes of gold and green
In the somber world of the blue

For you,
You the unveiled True
Truth beauty, and beauty you
A keits reference
And I reference
