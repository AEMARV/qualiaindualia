Unchained

And why resist the sensation
The motion
The revolution
You
Laying in satin hair
And Gold meet the Silver

Smile, honey sweet
Voice, a perfect symphony
Oh The guarded deity within

The moment is here
I am here
You there
I can be free, you can be free
And the key is to imagine What to do with free
Your guard is next to you
Surrounding you
Covering the lights
Covering the sounds
Covering the sense
Takes you away from kisses
Takes you away from the sights of desired
Breaks you away from embrace

In the name that is called security,
 in the name that is called body
In the name of ability

The self restraint
The guard, the crust
The fixed, the built
Carved stones and walls
Hard rocks
The mechanic, the mechanical language,
The mechanical dance, 
Mechanical dance of the lips,
Dance of the hands,
the mechanical push
The mechanics of action,
And spontaneous rejection and reaction
Hard rocks, hitting hard rocks. They shout no

In the name of body,
in the name of security
In the name of ability

Safe but no sensation
Safe but no perception
And Why resist the sensation
And sensation is soft,
And soft delays rejection, soft delays reaction
And in delay lives perception

soft is alive
And in alive lives creation

Venus is you, sensitive
Sensible, smile honey sweet
Voice a perfect symphony,
Tender in skin
Soft in all sensations,
For you and me
Venus is you within
Venus is you, the who that you is blind to
The who that mirrors never show to you
Venus in you
Venus is you

Empty the mind for a moment
No matter who I am
No matter what I am named
No matter how I look
No matter how I apear or apeared
I am me
You know me
You saw me in names
You saw me in memories
You deamt me
You tasted me in here and in there
You looked for me
This form and that
This land or not
Distant or not
And here is me
The crystal is in me
Soft in skin, diamond within
And Heres the juice of me
Now, how do you want to be
How do you want me to be

You tasted me in your first kisses
For a moment, so brief
You tasted me when you climbed that tree
You tasted me in the fresh breeze of the sea
Only you hold the key
To open the walls that held you from you and me
Only you hold the key, to see, to sense
To do, to break
Put the key in the lock
What do you do with free?
That is the key

And heres the fruit that is me
You knew the taste of me
How do you choose to be
How do you want me to be
What color you want to paint me
Blue?
Green?

Its time,
Desire free and tell me free
Do me free
Kiss my lips for free
Touch my hair for free
And Ill take your pain for free
the embrace is free
Venus, Desire free
Be free
Love does not come for free
But When its here
Its free to hold me dearly
Its free to hold you dearly
